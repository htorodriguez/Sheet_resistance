# Sheet_resistance
Simple app to correlate sheet resistance, resistivity and thickness of a conductive film. Typical resisitivities can be found on the resisitivity page of wikipedia _https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity_

# Instalation
Run the app in R studio. The app is running in the shiny server under _https://htorodriguez.shinyapps.io/Sheet_resistance/_
